# Heart and Respiration Rate detection with accelerometer
Accelerometers contained in recent smartphones 
are sufficiently precise to detect small accelerations, 
like to ones induces on the thorax by the beating of the heart 
and movement of the lungs. In this project is develop an algorithm 
to analyze accelerometric signals collected with a smartphone 
positioned on the thorax while supine. 
The signals was collected with an app created for the topic. 
The goal is the algorithm which has to compute the heart rate 
and respiration rate. The validation of the code was performed 
by recording signal with different (controlled) respiration rates 
and the use of a finger oximeter for the groud truth of the heart rate.
